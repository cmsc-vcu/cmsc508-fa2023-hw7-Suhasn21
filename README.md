# Welcome to Homework 7

Description:

This assignment We explore the creation and modification of entity-relation (ER) diagrams. ER diagrams represent the first step in database design, the initial step towards realizing real-world systems into computer-based solutions.

The objective of this assignment:

This assignment  demonstrates proficiency in SQL through the creation, population, and querying of a relational database.

The database itself is structured to hold information about individuals (people), their skills (skills), the roles they may occupy (roles), and the specific skills each person has (peopleskills). There is also a table that maps people to their roles (peopleroles).

Each table is intended to serve a specific function within the database. The sample queries provided in the document are practical examples of how to extract meaningful information from this dataset, such as finding all people with a certain skill or role, listing unused skills, and identifying people without any registered skills. The queries are designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment, using Python to connect to and interact with the MySQL database.

Tool Proficiency: The assignment also touches on the technical aspect of converting conceptual models into visual diagrams using specific tools (DOT or Mermaid). This ensures students understand the theoretical concepts and gain practical skills in rendering these designs with alignment in creating a DDL and implementing sql queries.

Critical Thinking: The exercise pushes one to decide how best to represent real-world scenarios. This includes identifying entities, defining relationships, and choosing appropriate attributes. Such decisions require both analytical reasoning and a touch of creativity.
